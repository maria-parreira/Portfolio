                        ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„ Hi, Iâ€™m Maria Parreira, a Software Developer based in Porto with roots in Ã‰vora, Portugal. Iâ€™m
                        currently seeking new and exciting opportunities in the tech world.

                        I recently completed the SWITCH postgraduation program at ISEP, where I honed my skills in front-end
                        development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React to create dynamic and engaging web interfaces. On
                        the back-end, I have a solid foundation in Java, Spring Boot, and JPA, and Iâ€™m proficient in
                        managing databases with MySQL. Additionally, I have experience with Docker, Jenkins, and Git, which
                        enables me to work efficiently in modern DevOps environments.

                        My background in veterinary medicine provided me with strong problem-solving skills, attention to
                        detail, and the ability to collaborate effectively within a team.

                        Beyond coding and work, Iâ€™m passionate about traveling, exploring new cultures, trying different
                        cuisines, spending time at the beach, hiking in the great outdoors, and camping.
